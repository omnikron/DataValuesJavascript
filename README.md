# DataValues Javascript

This component is in alpha state and not suitable for reuse yet.
It contains various JavaScript related to the DataValues library.

TODO: remove dependency on ApiParserValue from the JS so ApiParseValue
can be removed. ApiParseValue is the only PHP class in this package and
is the only thing that depends on the DataValues PHP components.
